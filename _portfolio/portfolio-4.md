* MacCormack and Rusanov schemes were implemented at various grid resolutions using Python and compared
	their behavior with respect to 2D Isentropic vortex formation and shock-vortex interaction in low and high Mach
	numbers.
* Implemented and analyzed enstrophy, vorticity source terms (dilatation and baroclinic torque), and contour
	plots to visualize the vortex behavior.
* Demonstrated the superiority of the MacCormack solver over the Rusanov scheme for isentropic vortex formation
	and Shock-Vortex interaction.
