## Abstract 
This Study focuses on approximating the 2-D incompressible buoyancy driven fluid flows 
incorporating Boussinesq Navier Stokes equations along with the advection equation with the help 
of Physics informed Neural Networks (PINNS) and an open-source library **DeepXDE**. The 
module DeepXDE is specifically built for PINNs and can be used to solve ordinary differential 
equations, partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. DeepXDE also provides 
the framework for operator learning networks (DeepONet).The main aim of this project is to build 
a neural network model respecting the laws of physics and governing the boundary and initial 
conditions to solve the partial differential equations. The difference in the losses when used 
different sampling techniques is observed. The loss value when used Latin Hypercube sampling is 
more than 1000 times when compared to a uniformly equally spaced sampling points.  

## Introduction
## Boussinesq Equations 

Boussinesq Navier-Stokes equations are non-linear partial differential equations. An extension of 
Navier-Stokes equations which are used to study the dynamics of buoyancy-driven fluid flows. 
These equations also account for the buoyancy effects due to the temperature variations in the fluid 
where the general Navier-Stokes equation do not. The equations are used in several applications 
such as meteorology, oceanography, and engineering to model natural convection. 
Equations such as the Navier-Stokes and its extension do not have an exact solution because of its 
highly non-linear terms. Traditional numerical methods which include finite element methods and 
finite volume methods are generally used to solve them but  requires high computational resources 
and complex coding of boundary conditions.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an extensive subject of computer science that focuses on building 
systems that can perform activities that normally require human intelligence. This include learning, 
solving problems, comprehending spoken language, and identifying patterns. Whereas Machine 
learning (ML) is a subset of the Artificial Intelligence which involves the development of 
algorithms using the data and make predictions out of it. ML models that can recognize patterns 
and make judgments with little to no human input are created using machine learning techniques. 
Neural Networks is special class of machine learning algorithm inspired by the structure of the 
human brain. With the use of layered nodes (neurons) provide an output based on the input data. 
NNs work especially well for applications like speech and picture recognition, natural language 
processing, and gaming. All the algorithms, be it neural networks or simple/complex machine 
learning are used to create/develop an AI application$$^{[1]}$$

## Objective 
This project's main goal is to use neural networks to estimate the 2D incompressible Boussinesq 
equations. These equations describe the motion of buoyancy-driven fluid flows and are represented 
by the set of partial differential equations (PDEs)$$^{[2]}$$:

$$
\left\{\begin{array}{c}
\partial_t u+u \cdot \nabla u+\nabla \mathrm{P}=v_x \partial_{x x} u+v_y \partial_{y y} u+\theta e_2 \\
\partial_t \theta+u \cdot \nabla \theta=k_{x x} \partial_{x x} \theta+k_{y y} \partial_{y y} \theta \\
\nabla \cdot \mathrm{u}=0
\end{array}\right.
$$

Where,$$ x = (x,y) Œß = (ùë•,ùë¶) \in R^2, t > 0$$ and $$u = (u,v)^T, P, \theta$$ denote, respectively, the velocity, 
pressure and buoyancy fields. The vertical unit vector $$e_2 = (0,1)^T$$ and $$v_x, v_y, k_x, k_y$$ are the 
viscosity and buoyancy diffusion coefficients respectively. The above equations can be simplified to the following for a 
partially dissipative system with a negligible thermal diffusion and when $$v_x, v_y = v$$.

1. X-momentum Equation: 

$$u_t + uu_x + vu_y + p_x -v(u_{xx} + u_{yy}) = 0 $$

2. Y-momentum Equation:

$$v_t + uv_x + vv_y + p_y -v(u_{xx} + u_{yy}) = 0 $$

3. Continuity Equation:

$$u_x + v_y = 0$$

4. Advection Equation:

$$\theta_t + u \theta_x + v \theta_y = 0$$

where,

- $$u$$ is the velocity of fluid in x-direction,
- $$v$$ is the velocity of fluid in y-direction, 
- $$p$$ is the pressure of the fluid,
- $$\theta$$ is the temperature,
- $$(x,y) \in ùëÖ^2$$ and
- $$t$$ is the time 

This project signifies the integration of Neural Networks and the laws of physics. This approach 
reduces the computational costs and improves the accuracy for higher dimension complex fluid 
dynamics problems when compared to traditional finite element methods$$^{[3]}$$. The scope of this 
project extends the use of neural network models to approximate the solutions for higher 
dimension non-linear partial differential equations with different hyper-parameters.

## Literature Review

McCulloch et.al in 1943, introduced the concept of deep learning, a subdivision of machine 
learning by explaining the working structure of biological neurons with a simple neural network 
using electrical circuits being active or inactive$$^{[4]}$$. Deep learning, a subclass of machine learning, 
uses many-layered neural networks‚Äîhence the term "deep" Large volumes of data can be 
modelled by these deep neural networks (DNNs) to represent intricate patterns. 

Frank Rosenblatt in 1958, using the brain cell activity from Hebb‚Äôs model, created the first feed
forward layered neural network model in an IBM 704 machine for image recognition. The machine 
built with a single input and single output layer, after multiple trials learned to distinguish between 
left and right marked cards$$^{[5]}$$. Ivakhnenko et.al, in 1967 published the work of a feed-forward 
multi-layered perceptron$$^{[6]}$$. 

Rumelhart et.al, in 1986 published a paper on backpropagation. The study outlines a number of 
neural networks where backpropagation operates significantly more quickly than in previous 
learning methodologies, enabling neural networks to be used to tackle problems that were 
previously thought to be intractable. The backpropagation method is currently the mainstay of 
neural network learning$$^{[7]}$$. NNs are trained by a process called backpropagation, in which the 
model uses the chain rule to determine the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight 
and then modifies the weights in order to minimize the loss. 

Maizar Raissi et.al, in 2017 introduced the concept of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). 
These networks are trained to solve and approximate the solution of a nonlinear partial differential 
equations by also governing the laws of physics$$^{[8]}$$. PINNs train neural networks using physical 
laws that are outlined by PDEs. PINNs use the problem's known physics, encoded in PDEs, to 
direct learning rather than just depending on data. In scientific computing, this method works 
especially well for tackling forward and inverse issues. 

![PINN](/images/2DBous/pinn.png)
<p align="center"><b> Figure 2: Working architecture of Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) </b></p>

Based on Fig.2, it can be understood that PINNs uses a feed-forward neural network with inputs 
as the known variables and generates a NN model to predict the output by also respecting the 
governing boundary conditions. PINNs uses automatic differentiation to calculate the differential 
operators and the loss functions of the PDE and the boundary conditions are calculated in the 
forward pass. During the backward pass, the weights and biases of the model are optimized using 
SCG, Adam, L-BFGS etc., to reduce the loss functions. The loss function can be calculated using 
a simple technique such as Mean Squared Error (MSE).  Once the loss meets the criteria of being 
lower than a specific tolerance, the iterations are stopped and the optimized NN model is used to 
predict the outputs.  

Lu Lu et.al, in 2020 created DeepXDE, an open-source python library and presented a paper 
showing the approximation theory, and error analysis of the physics-informed neural networks 
(PINNs) for solving different types of partial differential equations (PDEs)$$^{[9]}$$.

## Methodology

The project is carried out in different stages: 

1. Formulation of PDE 
2. Creating the domain and 
the spatial-temporal geometry 
3. Generating the data for training using random sampling and 
another data using uniformly spaced points
4. Defining the neural network
5. Compiling, Training 
and Validating the NN model
6. Predicting the output using the final model and visualization of 
the data.  

Unlike regular inputs for NN model, in PINNs, the co-ordinates $$(ùë•,ùë¶,ùë°) \in ùëÖ^2$$ inside the domain 
are the input data and the output of the model approximates the unknown values in the Boussinesq 
equations $$ùë¢,ùë£,ùëù, \theta =ùêπ(ùë•,ùë¶,ùë°)$$. 

Partial Differential Equations The Boussinesq equations (1.1) are  

$$
\begin{gathered}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t}+u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+v \cdot \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}-v\left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}\right)=0 \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t}+u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+v \cdot \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial P}{\partial x}-v\left(\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2}+\frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2}\right)=0 \\
\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}=0 \\
\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial t}+u \cdot \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}+v \cdot \frac{\partial \theta}{\partial y}=0
\end{gathered}
$$

### Boundary Conditions 

As mentioned earlier, this project focuses on solving the PDE using a new numerical method PINNs. The boundary and initial conditions in used to 
solve the Boussinesq equations is no-slip boundary condition on the walls using the Dirichlet boundary condition, and 

$$
\begin{gathered}
ùë¢_0(ùë•,ùë¶) = ùë†ùëñùëõ(2\piùë¶) ùë†ùëñùëõ2(\piùë•)\\
ùë£_0(ùë•,ùë¶) = ‚àí ùë†ùëñùëõ(2\piùë•) ùë†ùëñùëõ2(\piùë¶)\\ 
ùúÉ_0 = ùë†ùëñùëõ(3ùë•) ùëêùëúùë†(2ùë¶) + (ùë•‚àí0.5)3 + 1/(ùë¶+10)
\end{gathered}
$$ 

as the initial conditions at time $$t=0$$. The kinematic viscosity $$(ùúà)$$ is assumed to be 1.

### Geometry and Domain 
The geometry of the domain is defined as a rectangle for the spatial domain $$[-1,1] \times [-1,1]$$. As for 
the time domain, it varies from $$t=0$$ to $$t=100$$. The spatial and time domain are integrated to form 
the spatial-temporal domain used in PINNs to define the data points. 

## Implementation

### Software and Libraries

NN open-source frameworks in python such as TensorFlow (developed by Google) and PyTorch 
(developed by Facebook) are used in this project to define the neural network model. These tools 
are helpful in building, training and deploying a deep learning model competently. 
For implementation of PINNs, the python library DeepXDE is used. DeepXDE uses TensorFlow, 
PyTorch, PaddlePaddle and JAX as backends to build and train the neural network. The geometry, 
PDE and the boundary conditions (BC & IC) are defined using the DeepXDE framework. For this 
project, TensorFlow is used as the backend of DeepXDE as it has the highest computational speed 
and supports most of the features for solving the Boussinesq equations. DeepXDE can also 
automatically choose the GPU as the main device for computation when TensorFlow is chosen as 
the backend. Other dependencies used by DeepXDE are Numpy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Scikit-Learn 
and Scikit-Optimize.  

Multiple interactive development environments of Python such as Anaconda, Jupyter Lab and 
Google Colab are used in this project to write the code and the final code is submitted as a job file 
in a High-Performance Computing Cluster (HPCC) provided by the Institute for Cyber-Enabled 
Research (ICER). For computational research, scholars from industry and academia can use 
cyberinfrastructure provided by ICER. Multidisciplinary research in all areas of computational 
sciences is supported by ICER$$^{[10]}$$. 

### Data Generation 

Two main methods are used to generate the training data which provides two different models. 
The training data for the first model is generated with a random sampling using Latin Hypercube 
Sampling (LHS). A statistical technique for producing parameter values that guarantees thorough 
coverage of the parameter space is called Latin **Hypercube Sampling (LHS)**. In order to avoid 
clustering and guarantee uniform exploration, it splits the range of each parameter into equally 
likely intervals and samples each interval exactly once. Because LHS requires fewer sample points 
for the same accuracy as simple random sampling, it is more efficient. It is versatile, applicable to 
a wide range of dimensions and distributions, and offers consistent coverage across 
multidimensional areas$$^{[11]}$$. 

For the latter model, the training data is generated in such a way that each point in the spatial
temporal domain is uniformly distributed with equal spacing. The total number of quadrature 
training points using LHS are 25k and the second model with uniformly spaced training points are 
25k. 

### Model Architecture 

For this project, a neural network architecture with multiple important components was created. 
Three inputs, $$x, y,$$ and $$t,$$ which stand for the spatial and temporal coordinates, are received by the 
input layer. Four hidden layers with a total of 80 neurons each are used in this network. To account 
for the non-linearity in the model, the activation function hyperbolic tangent function (tanh) is 
used, and the output layer provides 4 outputs $$u,v,P$$ and $$T$$ corresponding to the velocity 
components, pressure, and temperature, respectively. The neural networks weights are initialized 
using the Xavier normal initialization method (Glorot normal) to maintain the variance of the 
activations and gradients across the layers of the network, which helps to avoid the vanishing or 
exploding gradient problems during training. 

The model training begins using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of $$1e-3$$ and 20000 
iterations. When the model reaches a good approximation using Adam, then it is refined using the 
L-BFGS optimizer with the maximum number of iterations set at 3000. L-BFGS is a quasi-Newton 
method that is particularly effective for optimizing differentiable functions, which helps in 
achieving a more precise and stable solution. 

### Training and Validation 

To make sure that the model follows the physical principles outlined by the governing equations 
as well as the underlying patterns in the data, the training procedure is carefully designed. The 
Adam optimizer is initially used to train the model. The learning rate is constantly adjusted 
throughout this phase using a learning rate schedule, which improves optimizer efficiency and 
helps avoid problems like under- or overfitting.  The L-BFGS optimizer is used to refine the model 
after the initial training. This is an important step since L-BFGS offers better convergence 
properties for model fine-tuning. 

The model's performance is assessed using a wide range of metrics and techniques. In order to 
guarantee that the model's predictions satisfy the physical laws, the loss function is constructed to 
incorporate the residuals of the partial differential equations (PDEs). Comparing the expected and 
actual values at different domain points is the process of validation. This comparison is necessary 
to evaluate the model's correctness and make sure it applies well to data that hasn't been seen 
before. 

## Results and Conclusion

The initial conditions used for training the model are visualized in Fig.3,

$$ 
\begin{gathered}
T(ùúÉ). ùë¢0(ùë•, ùë¶) = ùë†ùëñùëõ(2ùúãùë¶)ùë†ùëñùëõ2(ùúãùë•) \\ 
ùë£0(ùë•,ùë¶) = ‚àí ùë†ùëñùëõ(2ùúãùë•)ùë†ùëñùëõ2(ùúãùë¶) \\
ùúÉ_0 = ùë†ùëñùëõ(3ùë•) ùëêùëúùë†(2ùë¶) + (ùë• ‚àí 0.5)3 + 1/(ùë¶ + 10)
\end{gathered}
$$

and Fig.4 illustrates the 
domain of two different models with Latin hypercube sampling and uniformly spaced sampling. 
The total number of training points used for network including PDE and BC training points are 
25k in each of the two models.

| Model | Sampling | Total Training Points | PDE points | BC points | Learning Rate | Total Loss |
|-------|----------|-----------------------|------------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| 1     | LHS      | 25000                 | 10000      | 15000     | 1.0E-3        | 1.4E-4     |

*Table 1: Model comparison of LHS and Uniform sampling*

After training the model with 20000 iterations using Adam optimizer and then refining it using 
L-BFGS optimizer, the total loss values for the first model is $$1.4e-4$$ and for the second model is 
$$2.27e+0$$. As DeepXDE uses its own sampling stratification for the distribution of training points, 
there is a lot of difference between the training points for the PDEs and the boundary conditions 
in both the models. Although, the total training points are almost same, the loss for model 1 as it 
was able to handle the noisy data.  

For model 1, the training and test loss become less than $$1e-3$$ after 2500 iterations. As per model 
2, the loss values although high come to a constant value after 1000 iterations. From this, we can 
conclude that, the number of iterations for the model does not effect the losses directly. Instead, 
it is the number of sampling points and its distribution.

<p align="center"><b> Figure 5:  Training and test losses for both Model 1 (Left) and Model 2 (Right) for a total of 20000 iterations and refining with the L-BFGS. </b></p>

Fig.6, shows the visualized distribution of temperature plots after using model 1 to approximate 
the solutions for the Boussinesq equations. It is quite surprising that even with a very low training 
loss of $$1.4e-4$$, model 1 is still not able to predict the temperature plots properly. It can be seen that 
at time $$t=0$$, the temperature plot does not match with the initial plot of temperature at $$t=0$$ (Fig.3). 
It can also be observed that after a certain time, the temperature distribution slowly comes to a 
state of equilibrium.

![Initial Results](/images/2DBous/fig7.png)
<p align="center"><b> Figure 7: Temperature Distribution plots predicted using Model 2 </b></p>

When used model 2, with higher loss compared to model 1 to predict the solutions of the 
Boussinesq equations, the temperature plots are entirely different. This was quite expected as the 
loss value was very high for model 2. Although, model 1 has better loss, it was still not predicted 
the value properly. As the exact solution for the Boussinesq equation is not known due to its high 
non-linearity nature, it cannot be confirmed if the predictions using model 1 are entirely incorrect.  

## Future Scope 

The models can be further optimized by changing the hyperparameters such as the learning rate, 
number of training points and the number of iterations. To decrease the computational time, the 
number of training points for the boundary and initial conditions used was less, which probably 
resulted in the incorrect approximation of the equations. By using the GPU sources of the HPCC 
provided by ICER, the computational time can be further increased even at higher sample points. 
This can be strongly backed as the study was initially started with only 5000 sample points and 
the loss values decreased as the number of sample points increased. Further study is continued on 
updating the boundary conditions to a no-penetration and a zero vorticity boundary conditions to 
approximate the Boussinesq equations with a greater number of sample points and also using the 
GPU resources. The updated models with the new boundary conditions and initial conditions will 
be compared with the results of the traditional methods$$^{[1]}$$ for the computational time and accuracy.
