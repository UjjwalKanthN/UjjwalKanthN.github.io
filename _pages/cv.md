Education
======
* M.S. Mechanical Engineering, University at Buffalo (SUNY), 2024
* B.S. Aeronautical Engineering, JNTUH, 2018

Work experience
======
* Research Assistant: [CET Laboratory](https://www.cet-lab.org/)

  University at Buffalo (SUNY)  (Aug 2022 - Jul 2024)
  
  * Conducted comprehensive research using Python and Matlab for data analysis, applying filtering techniques to
	optimize measurement techniques for residential wood stoves, increasing testing accuracy.	
  * Formulated and validated a catalytic chemistry sub-system using Python and Cantera, leveraging reactor network 
	modeling and kinetic simulations, and CFD analysis, optimizing energy efficiency and reducing emissions.
  * Mounted and calibrated thermocouples, airflow sensors, and emissions gas analyzers; recorded and analyzed
	data using LabVIEW for accurate combustion diagnostics and system performance evaluation.

* Project Associate: [TDCE](https://mech.iitm.ac.in/mechlab/tdce/)
  
  IIT, Madras (Feb 2020 - Aug 2021)
  
  * Developed a comprehensive study on Biodiesel combustion processes using chemical kinetics and combustion
	modeling, and CFD analysis focusing on unsaturation levels, increasing combustion efficiency in laboratory tests.
  * Contributed to the Surrogate Model Development for Karanja Methyl Esters (KME) focusing on enhancing
	combustion characteristics and emissions profiles for biodiesel fuels through kinetic modeling and CFD.
  * Developed a Python-based tool for surrogate fuel calculations, which computes approximate mole fractions based
	on functional group and property group targets, streamlining the biodiesel combustion modeling process.
