Hey there traveller! I’m Sai Ujjwal Kanth, currently pretending to be a full-time graduate from the University at Buffalo, where 
I’m knee-deep in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), combustion modeling, and making high-performance computers do the heavy lifting. 
You know, the usual "save the world with better fluid simulations" kind of stuff. My days are spent developing custom solvers in OpenFOAM, 
Python, and C++, because apparently, that’s what I do for fun.

With a background in Aeronautical Engineering (yep, I thought about designing cool jets for a living), I’ve worked on everything from 
scramjet combustor dynamics to biodiesel combustion modeling — all the while trying to make engines and simulations run faster and 
cleaner (you’re welcome, planet Earth). I’ve also had my fair share of messing around with simulation tools like ANSYS, Paraview, and 
STAR-CCM+, which somehow led me to become a CFD nerd of sorts.

When I’m not buried in code or tweaking solvers, you’ll probably find me headbanging and playing the guitar or volunteering to mentor underprivileged 
kids — because why not mix a little music and good karma into the equation? And just for fun, I might casually drop in that I’ve handled 
actual aircraft engines during internships. No big deal.

So, whether you're into fluid dynamics, guitar solos, or just want to geek out about something cool, let’s connect and make the world a slightly
more efficient place and sustainable!
