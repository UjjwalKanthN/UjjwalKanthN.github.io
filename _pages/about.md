Hi, I'm Sai Ujjwal Kanth Nandula, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University at Buffalo, with expertise in CFD, Combustion Modeling, and High-Performance Computing. I develop custom tools 
and solvers using OpenFOAM, Python, and C++. My experience spans various CFD and Combustion modeling projects, optimizing performance through custom tools and solvers. Check out my projects 
[here](https://ujjwalkanthn.github.io/portfolio/).

Beyond simulations, I explore emerging technologies and push the boundaries of computational engineering. I'm also an avid guitarist, balancing technical rigor with creativity.

Currently, I'm seeking roles in **Mechanical**, **CFD** and **Thermal Engineering**. If you're looking for technical expertise with a creative edge, let's
