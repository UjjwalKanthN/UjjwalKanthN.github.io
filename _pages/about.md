Hi, I’m Sai Ujjwal Kanth Nandula, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University at Buffalo, specializing in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Combustion Modeling, and High-Performance Computing. I’m passionate about solving complex engineering problems by developing custom tools and solvers, utilizing platforms like OpenFOAM, Python, and C++. With a strong foundation in Aeronautical Engineering, I’ve contributed to a diverse array of projects, from scramjet combustor simulations to biodiesel combustion modeling, optimizing performance through high-powered computing clusters. You can check some of my projects [here](https://ujjwalkanthn.github.io/portfolio/).

Beyond simulations and code, I enjoy exploring emerging technologies and constantly pushing the boundaries of what computational engineering can achieve. I’m also an avid guitarist, because balancing technical rigor with creative pursuits makes the journey more rewarding.

If you’re looking for someone who blends technical expertise with a creative edge, let’s connect and see how we can push the boundaries of innovation together!
