Hi, I’m Sai Ujjwal Kanth, a Mechanical Engineering graduate from the University at Buffalo, specializing in Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Combustion Modeling, and High Performance Computing. I enjoy solving complex engineering problems by developing custom tools and solvers, whether it's in OpenFOAM, Python, or C++. With a solid background in Aeronautical Engineering, I’ve worked on a wide range of projects, from scramjet combustor simulations to biodiesel combustion modeling, all while optimizing performance on high-powered computing clusters.

When I’m not immersed in simulations or fine-tuning algorithms, I’m passionate about mentoring and volunteering, helping underprivileged kids build essential skills. Oh, and I’m also an avid guitarist, because why should engineers have all the fun with just numbers and code?

If you’re looking for someone who blends technical expertise with a creative edge, let’s connect and see how we can push the boundaries of innovation together!
